## Introduction
This repository is designed for beginners to learn the basics of Node.js. It includes simple projects that teach you how to use Node.js modules, create a server, manipulate files, generate random passwords, and send emails. By the end of this project, you'll have a solid foundation for building more advanced Node.js applications.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Hello World
- **File Name**: `hello-world.js`
- **Objective**: Write a program that prints "HELLO WORLD" to the console.
- **Description**: This task introduces the concept of writing and executing a basic Node.js program.

### Task 2: Create a Server
- **File Name**: `server.js`
- **Objective**: Create a basic server that listens on port 3000 and responds with a message.
- **Description**: In this task, you'll use the `http` module to create a server that responds to requests with the message: `<h1>Hello Node!!!!</h1>`.

### Task 3: File System Operations
- **File Name**: `file-operations.js`
- **Objective**: Read and write files using the `fs` module.
- **Description**: This task requires you to create a file named `welcome.txt` and write "Hello Node" to it, then read and log the content of the file.

### Task 4: Password Generator
- **File Name**: `password-generator.js`
- **Objective**: Generate a random password.
- **Description**: Using the `generate-password` npm package, you will create a function that generates a random password and logs it to the console.

### Task 5: Email Sender
- **File Name**: `email-sender.js`
- **Objective**: Send an email using Node.js.
- **Description**: This task involves using the `nodemailer` package to send an email. Youâ€™ll need to configure it with your own email credentials (make sure to delete personal information before uploading the code to GitHub).
